The blocks of pre-formated codes are used to write on the programming or highlight a source code. More than of simple paragraph, the lines of code of a block of code are literally interpreted

following is an example

    for example:

      This is `un bloc de code en ligne`

 You can define the language used to highlight the syntax by adding a name on an opening keyword. Example:

    ```js
    var a = {};
    ```
